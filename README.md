# Coursera Machine Learning Classification

Classification is one of the most widely used, most fundamental areas of machine learning. The goal of a classifier is to learn from the input X to the output Y.

### Examples

What ads to show on a web page depending on the content of the page. The goal here would be to take the text of the web page and categorize it automatically as to whether it's kind of educations site, financial site, technology site and position the ads accordingly.

Perhaps the most common type of classifier that we see everyday, every time we open up our email is a famous spam filter. So the spam filter takes every emails that arrives and makes a prediction on whether this is a spam email. And that prediction needs to be based not just on the test of the email but on other information we get from that email, like who was the sender, what was the IP address, other messages that the sender sent... and from that information, the system will learn the mapping from those inputs to whether this is spam or not. Early on, we used keyword search or keyword classifiers... and they were not good.

We can build all sort of classifiers.

The idea of classifiers can be extremely useful for a wide range of domains. For example, in the area of personalised medecine. The medecine today is that based on the same conditions, we make the same predictions for anyone independant of the fact that we are different people. Personalised medecine aims to totally change that. It's going to look at our DNA sequences and find a good treatment for each one of us. And maybe even look at our lifestyle. And based on that kind information, we can predict the condition and what treatment is going to be the most effective.

Machine Learning can read your mind. The work of Tom Mitchell. You take a scan of your brain as you look at a word, and based on that image from the FMRI, the algorithm can make a prediction as to what kind of word you are reading. Today, we can train a classifier on your brain images based on words that you read, and then use it to predict something from brain images of pictures that you see.


Classifiers have really change the world. 

Interestingly about classifiers is that the fundamental techniques that you need to build a classifier are very similar to those you need to build all other sorts of machine learning models.
